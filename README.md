# MEV FLASHBOTS UNLEASHED

## Intro
A comprehensive data analysis of Flashbots MEV as a submission for the [Encode](https://www.encode.club) x [Wintermute](https://www.wintermute.com) hackathon with [Flashbots](https://www.flashbots.net/).

The data analysis has been done using the datasets provided by Flashbots to [Dune](https://dune.com) (formerly Dune Analytics) and deep dive on MEV extracted, miner payments, MEV transactions, arbitrages, liquidations, sandwiches (including MEV leaderboards).
The Flashbots MEV data available on Dune starts on August 28 2020.
